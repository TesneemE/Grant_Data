    "text": "The project unfolds in three phases: development (curriculum design, video production, challenge creation), review and testing (course material review, pilot testing, feedback incorporation), and launch (official integration into the Journey Platform), spanning from J March to May 2024. The budget for this comprehensive course development, including all resources, personnel, and technology requirements, is set at $5,000. A significant portion of the budget would likely be directed towards curriculum design and the production of engaging video content, including hiring subject matter experts and video production teams. This could involve costs related to scripting, filming, editing, and creating interactive elements for the course. Additional funds would be allocated to the development of challenges and learning materials, ensuring that they are both educational and engaging for participants. The review and testing phase, including pilot testing and feedback incorporation, would require resources for participant incentives and technology tools to facilitate feedback collection and analysis. Finally, a part of the budget would support the integration of the course into the Journey Platform, covering technical support and potential platform enhancements to accommodate the new course.\n\nThis investment is aimed at not only providing students with an in-depth understanding of AI and its applications for social impact, but also at preparing them with the entrepreneurial competencies necessary to innovate and thrive in the digital age.\n\nCurrent education systems fail to adequately teach students evolving digital skills, and even when taught, they are expected to be practiced in off-school settings that require necessary devices and internet connectivity. The Pew Research Center reports that 15% of U.S. households with school-age children do not have a high-speed internet connection at home, with low-income families and Black and Hispanic households being disproportionately affected. A recent report by the National Skills Coalition shows that in 2023, 92% of jobs across every industry analyzed in the U.S. require digital skills - a number that will continue to grow. Workers who qualify for jobs requiring even one digital skill can earn an average of 23% more than those in jobs with no digital skills. Thus, it\u2019s imperative to equip BIPOC students with the digital literacy and skills required to enter the future job market and elevate their future communities.\n\nLow-income communities are particularly in need of digital and financial literacy and skills to enter the future job market\u2014a Pew report recently found that less than 30% of the entrepreneurial workforce are BIPOC and less than 2% of VC funding goes to founders of color. AI is expected to disrupt all industries, but also to deepen inequalities between those with AI literacy, and those without. Already, early evidence has shown that generative AI literacy leads to 30% improvements in productivity. Imagine if this were deployed in the social impact space for diverse, underestimated entrepreneurs in our neighborhoods. \n\nCambio Labs would conduct outreach for the AI course development project by leveraging its established networks and community partners, utilizing digital platforms, and hosting community engagement events. Cambio Labs would organize workshops or informational sessions, either virtually or in person, to provide a deeper understanding of the course content and its benefits for potential participants. Through these activities, Cambio Labs aims to attract participants who are keen on leveraging AI for social good, while also supporting their journey in business model development, stakeholder mapping, and empathy research.  \n\nTo ensure sustainability, we would strategically incorporate ongoing feedback from our users and diverse partners. This approach allows us to invest in curricular and technological enhancements, ensuring that our participants are equipped with the most innovative tools. Our goal is to prepare them for success in a rapidly changing, technology-driven economy and to enable them to make a meaningful social impact.",

    "question": "The project unfolds in three phases:",
    "answer": "The project unfolds in three phases: development (curriculum design, video production, challenge creation), review and testing (course material review, pilot testing, feedback incorporation), and launch (official integration into the Journey Platform), spanning from J March to May 2024. The budget for this comprehensive course development, including all resources, personnel, and technology requirements, is set at $5,000. A significant portion of the budget would likely be directed towards curriculum design and the production of engaging video content, including hiring subject matter experts and video production teams. This could involve costs related to scripting, filming, editing, and creating interactive elements for the course. Additional funds would be allocated to the development of challenges and learning materials, ensuring that they are both educational and engaging for participants. The review and testing phase, including pilot testing and feedback incorporation, would require resources for participant incentives and technology tools to facilitate feedback collection and analysis. Finally, a part of the budget would support the integration of the course into the Journey Platform, covering technical support and potential platform enhancements to accommodate the new course.\n\nThis investment is aimed at not only providing students with an in-depth understanding of AI and its applications for social impact, but also at preparing them with the entrepreneurial competencies necessary to innovate and thrive in the digital age.\n\nCurrent education systems fail to adequately teach students evolving digital skills, and even when taught, they are expected to be practiced in off-school settings that require necessary devices and internet connectivity. The Pew Research Center reports that 15% of U.S. households with school-age children do not have a high-speed internet connection at home, with low-income families and Black and Hispanic households being disproportionately affected. A recent report by the National Skills Coalition shows that in 2023, 92% of jobs across every industry analyzed in the U.S. require digital skills - a number that will continue to grow. Workers who qualify for jobs requiring even one digital skill can earn an average of 23% more than those in jobs with no digital skills. Thus, it\u2019s imperative to equip BIPOC students with the digital literacy and skills required to enter the future job market and elevate their future communities.\n\nLow-income communities are particularly in need of digital and financial literacy and skills to enter the future job market\u2014a Pew report recently found that less than 30% of the entrepreneurial workforce are BIPOC and less than 2% of VC funding goes to founders of color. AI is expected to disrupt all industries, but also to deepen inequalities between those with AI literacy, and those without. Already, early evidence has shown that generative AI literacy leads to 30% improvements in productivity. Imagine if this were deployed in the social impact space for diverse, underestimated entrepreneurs in our neighborhoods. \n\nCambio Labs would conduct outreach for the AI course development project by leveraging its established networks and community partners, utilizing digital platforms, and hosting community engagement events. Cambio Labs would organize workshops or informational sessions, either virtually or in person, to provide a deeper understanding of the course content and its benefits for potential participants. Through these activities, Cambio Labs aims to attract participants who are keen on leveraging AI for social good, while also supporting their journey in business model development, stakeholder mapping, and empathy research.  \n\nTo ensure sustainability, we would strategically incorporate ongoing feedback from our users and diverse partners. This approach allows us to invest in curricular and technological enhancements, ensuring that our participants are equipped with the most innovative tools. Our goal is to prepare them for success in a rapidly changing, technology-driven economy and to enable them to make a meaningful social impact.",

    "question": "The project unfolds in three phases:",
    "answer": "The project unfolds in three phases: development (curriculum design, video production, challenge creation), review and testing (course material review, pilot testing, feedback incorporation), and launch (official integration into the Journey Platform), spanning from J March to May 2024. The budget for this comprehensive course development, including all resources, personnel, and technology requirements, is set at $5,000. A significant portion of the budget would likely be directed towards curriculum design and the production of engaging video content, including hiring subject matter experts and video production teams. This could involve costs related to scripting, filming, editing, and creating interactive elements for the course. Additional funds would be allocated to the development of challenges and learning materials, ensuring that they are both educational and engaging for participants. The review and testing phase, including pilot testing and feedback incorporation, would require resources for participant incentives and technology tools to facilitate feedback collection and analysis. Finally, a part of the budget would support the integration of the course into the Journey Platform, covering technical support and potential platform enhancements to accommodate the new course.\n\nThis investment is aimed at not only providing students with an in-depth understanding of AI and its applications for social impact, but also at preparing them with the entrepreneurial competencies necessary to innovate and thrive in the digital age.\n\nCurrent education systems fail to adequately teach students evolving digital skills, and even when taught, they are expected to be practiced in off-school settings that require necessary devices and internet connectivity. The Pew Research Center reports that 15% of U.S. households with school-age children do not have a high-speed internet connection at home, with low-income families and Black and Hispanic households being disproportionately affected. A recent report by the National Skills Coalition shows that in 2023, 92% of jobs across every industry analyzed in the U.S. require digital skills - a number that will continue to grow. Workers who qualify for jobs requiring even one digital skill can earn an average of 23% more than those in jobs with no digital skills. Thus, it\u2019s imperative to equip BIPOC students with the digital literacy and skills required to enter the future job market and elevate their future communities.\n\nLow-income communities are particularly in need of digital and financial literacy and skills to enter the future job market\u2014a Pew report recently found that less than 30% of the entrepreneurial workforce are BIPOC and less than 2% of VC funding goes to founders of color. AI is expected to disrupt all industries, but also to deepen inequalities between those with AI literacy, and those without. Already, early evidence has shown that generative AI literacy leads to 30% improvements in productivity. Imagine if this were deployed in the social impact space for diverse, underestimated entrepreneurs in our neighborhoods. \n\nCambio Labs would conduct outreach for the AI course development project by leveraging its established networks and community partners, utilizing digital platforms, and hosting community engagement events. Cambio Labs would organize workshops or informational sessions, either virtually or in person, to provide a deeper understanding of the course content and its benefits for potential participants. Through these activities, Cambio Labs aims to attract participants who are keen on leveraging AI for social good, while also supporting their journey in business model development, stakeholder mapping, and empathy research.  \n\nTo ensure sustainability, we would strategically incorporate ongoing feedback from our users and diverse partners. This approach allows us to invest in curricular and technological enhancements, ensuring that our participants are equipped with the most innovative tools. Our goal is to prepare them for success in a rapidly changing, technology-driven economy and to enable them to make a meaningful social impact.",
