    "text": "What motivated you to apply for the PLACE Builders fellowship? How do you believe this program will enhance your ability to support and grow your local entrepreneurial ecosystem? *\n\nMaximum 200 words\n\nI applied for the PLACE Builders Fellowship because of the way that this initiative focuses on supporting \u201cequitable entrepreneurial ecosystem builders\u201d. This seems so specific, and like an apt description of the type of work that I do with Cambio Labs - so I feel like I would be uniquely seen and understood among the PLACE builders community, and  uniquely qualified to be part of this cohort. I am also very connected to making an impact on New York City - leveraging partnerships across NYC infrastructure, government agencies, organizations, and citizens - and I feel like the Place Builders program could help improve my strategies to create place-based infrastructure, programs, and technology that can serve underestimated entrepreneurs in my city.\n\nI think the PLACE will deepen my understanding of social innovation practice, and will enable me to learn from the perspectives and strategies of change makers that I never would have otherwise met. I think that being part of such an immersive educational and communal experience may make me a more effective social entrepreneur as well as give me a new network of potential collaborators, supporters, and accountability partners that I could build with to scale our solutions nationally or internationally. \n\nI am eager to be connected to different changemakers across the country, a new network of collaborators, and resources like training and funding that will benefit me on my social entrepreneurial journey.  \n\nEight builders representing regions across the country will have an opportunity to build their capacity through training, peer support, and community pilots. Fellows will have access to professional mentorship, a digital toolkit, community, funding, and a platform to tell the stories about the places they love to a broader audience. By the end of the fellowship, each builder will also have identified, developed, and launched a pilot project to either address an ecosystem gap or scale something that\u2019s working well.\n\nBy the end of this fellowship, you will have identified, developed, and launched a pilot project. Can you outline a potential project idea that addresses an ecosystem gap or scales something that\u2019s working well in your community? Please explain how this project aligns with the goals of the PLACE Builders program. *\n\nDon't worry - you will not be beholden to this particular proposal and a very rough outline for a vision is fine. Maximum 300 words.\n\nA potential pilot project that we would like to launch is called Startup NYCHA - an initiative to bring entrepreneurship programs and business development support to public housing residents - who have historically been divested in, and where there exists a lot of untapped entrepreneurship that could create jobs  and generational wealth.\n\nUnemployment rates in public housing developments in New York City are three times higher than the citywide average, with 20% of residents being unemployed compared to 7% in the city as a whole. The median income for households in public housing developments in New York City is $24,000 per year, compared to the citywide median income of $71,000 per year.  According to the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the rate of business creation in lower-income areas is significantly lower than the rest of NYC. Providing support for business creation and strengthening durable skills is one way that residents can create employment and wealth for their communities.\n\nIn our vision all New Yorkers, regardless of zip code or income level, would have access to economic opportunity, business ownership, and the tools of innovation. Through the Startup NYCHA program, residents would be able to launch their own companies or cooperatives, secure employment and internship opportunities, and launch community-based projects that address local social and environmental challenges.  NYCHA would become a place where people\u2019s entrepreneurial visions could thrive.\n\nWe hope to start a city-wide entrepreneurial movement within NYCHA by demonstrating what is possible when we provide underestimated youth and adults with the programs, support, and resources to become founders of socially and environmentally responsible businesses and organizations. Eventually, we would like to replicate this model in other cities.\n\nI think this pilot program idea aligns with the PLACE Builder program\u2019s focus on equitable entrepreneurial ecosystems that are place-based.",

    "question": "What motivated you to apply for the PLACE Builders fellowship?",
    "answer": "What motivated you to apply for the PLACE Builders fellowship? How do you believe this program will enhance your ability to support and grow your local entrepreneurial ecosystem? *\n\nMaximum 200 words\n\nI applied for the PLACE Builders Fellowship because of the way that this initiative focuses on supporting \u201cequitable entrepreneurial ecosystem builders\u201d. This seems so specific, and like an apt description of the type of work that I do with Cambio Labs - so I feel like I would be uniquely seen and understood among the PLACE builders community, and  uniquely qualified to be part of this cohort. I am also very connected to making an impact on New York City - leveraging partnerships across NYC infrastructure, government agencies, organizations, and citizens - and I feel like the Place Builders program could help improve my strategies to create place-based infrastructure, programs, and technology that can serve underestimated entrepreneurs in my city.\n\nI think the PLACE will deepen my understanding of social innovation practice, and will enable me to learn from the perspectives and strategies of change makers that I never would have otherwise met. I think that being part of such an immersive educational and communal experience may make me a more effective social entrepreneur as well as give me a new network of potential collaborators, supporters, and accountability partners that I could build with to scale our solutions nationally or internationally. \n\nI am eager to be connected to different changemakers across the country, a new network of collaborators, and resources like training and funding that will benefit me on my social entrepreneurial journey.  \n\nEight builders representing regions across the country will have an opportunity to build their capacity through training, peer support, and community pilots. Fellows will have access to professional mentorship, a digital toolkit, community, funding, and a platform to tell the stories about the places they love to a broader audience. By the end of the fellowship, each builder will also have identified, developed, and launched a pilot project to either address an ecosystem gap or scale something that\u2019s working well.\n\nBy the end of this fellowship, you will have identified, developed, and launched a pilot project. Can you outline a potential project idea that addresses an ecosystem gap or scales something that\u2019s working well in your community? Please explain how this project aligns with the goals of the PLACE Builders program. *\n\nDon't worry - you will not be beholden to this particular proposal and a very rough outline for a vision is fine. Maximum 300 words.\n\nA potential pilot project that we would like to launch is called Startup NYCHA - an initiative to bring entrepreneurship programs and business development support to public housing residents - who have historically been divested in, and where there exists a lot of untapped entrepreneurship that could create jobs  and generational wealth.\n\nUnemployment rates in public housing developments in New York City are three times higher than the citywide average, with 20% of residents being unemployed compared to 7% in the city as a whole. The median income for households in public housing developments in New York City is $24,000 per year, compared to the citywide median income of $71,000 per year.  According to the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the rate of business creation in lower-income areas is significantly lower than the rest of NYC. Providing support for business creation and strengthening durable skills is one way that residents can create employment and wealth for their communities.\n\nIn our vision all New Yorkers, regardless of zip code or income level, would have access to economic opportunity, business ownership, and the tools of innovation. Through the Startup NYCHA program, residents would be able to launch their own companies or cooperatives, secure employment and internship opportunities, and launch community-based projects that address local social and environmental challenges.  NYCHA would become a place where people\u2019s entrepreneurial visions could thrive.\n\nWe hope to start a city-wide entrepreneurial movement within NYCHA by demonstrating what is possible when we provide underestimated youth and adults with the programs, support, and resources to become founders of socially and environmentally responsible businesses and organizations. Eventually, we would like to replicate this model in other cities.\n\nI think this pilot program idea aligns with the PLACE Builder program\u2019s focus on equitable entrepreneurial ecosystems that are place-based.",

    "question": "What motivated you to apply for the PLACE Builders fellowship?",
    "answer": "What motivated you to apply for the PLACE Builders fellowship? How do you believe this program will enhance your ability to support and grow your local entrepreneurial ecosystem? *\n\nMaximum 200 words\n\nI applied for the PLACE Builders Fellowship because of the way that this initiative focuses on supporting \u201cequitable entrepreneurial ecosystem builders\u201d. This seems so specific, and like an apt description of the type of work that I do with Cambio Labs - so I feel like I would be uniquely seen and understood among the PLACE builders community, and  uniquely qualified to be part of this cohort. I am also very connected to making an impact on New York City - leveraging partnerships across NYC infrastructure, government agencies, organizations, and citizens - and I feel like the Place Builders program could help improve my strategies to create place-based infrastructure, programs, and technology that can serve underestimated entrepreneurs in my city.\n\nI think the PLACE will deepen my understanding of social innovation practice, and will enable me to learn from the perspectives and strategies of change makers that I never would have otherwise met. I think that being part of such an immersive educational and communal experience may make me a more effective social entrepreneur as well as give me a new network of potential collaborators, supporters, and accountability partners that I could build with to scale our solutions nationally or internationally. \n\nI am eager to be connected to different changemakers across the country, a new network of collaborators, and resources like training and funding that will benefit me on my social entrepreneurial journey.  \n\nEight builders representing regions across the country will have an opportunity to build their capacity through training, peer support, and community pilots. Fellows will have access to professional mentorship, a digital toolkit, community, funding, and a platform to tell the stories about the places they love to a broader audience. By the end of the fellowship, each builder will also have identified, developed, and launched a pilot project to either address an ecosystem gap or scale something that\u2019s working well.\n\nBy the end of this fellowship, you will have identified, developed, and launched a pilot project. Can you outline a potential project idea that addresses an ecosystem gap or scales something that\u2019s working well in your community? Please explain how this project aligns with the goals of the PLACE Builders program. *\n\nDon't worry - you will not be beholden to this particular proposal and a very rough outline for a vision is fine. Maximum 300 words.\n\nA potential pilot project that we would like to launch is called Startup NYCHA - an initiative to bring entrepreneurship programs and business development support to public housing residents - who have historically been divested in, and where there exists a lot of untapped entrepreneurship that could create jobs  and generational wealth.\n\nUnemployment rates in public housing developments in New York City are three times higher than the citywide average, with 20% of residents being unemployed compared to 7% in the city as a whole. The median income for households in public housing developments in New York City is $24,000 per year, compared to the citywide median income of $71,000 per year.  According to the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the rate of business creation in lower-income areas is significantly lower than the rest of NYC. Providing support for business creation and strengthening durable skills is one way that residents can create employment and wealth for their communities.\n\nIn our vision all New Yorkers, regardless of zip code or income level, would have access to economic opportunity, business ownership, and the tools of innovation. Through the Startup NYCHA program, residents would be able to launch their own companies or cooperatives, secure employment and internship opportunities, and launch community-based projects that address local social and environmental challenges.  NYCHA would become a place where people\u2019s entrepreneurial visions could thrive.\n\nWe hope to start a city-wide entrepreneurial movement within NYCHA by demonstrating what is possible when we provide underestimated youth and adults with the programs, support, and resources to become founders of socially and environmentally responsible businesses and organizations. Eventually, we would like to replicate this model in other cities.\n\nI think this pilot program idea aligns with the PLACE Builder program\u2019s focus on equitable entrepreneurial ecosystems that are place-based.",
