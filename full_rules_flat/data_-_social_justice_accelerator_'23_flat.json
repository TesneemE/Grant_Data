Why Cambio Labs?\n\nWe build cross-sectoral, community-based partnerships to allow for paid, work-based learning opportunities.\n\nOne example is our work with the RETI Center through our Green Workforce Development Initiative.  For 4 cohorts since 2021; participants have obtained stipends through Good Shepherd Services; Solar Panel Installation training through Brooklyn SolarWorks; Certification from OSHA and the Green Urban Council; and a certificate in Green Entrepreneurship through Cambio Labs. We were also able to digitalize the RETI Centers\u2019 coursework in solar panel installation on our platform, allowing this kind of programming to become more interactive, effective, and scalable.\n\nWe leverage and design technology to engage and empower underestimated communities\n\nOur program is designed to enable participants to harness technology and entrepreneurship as tools for social change.  We do this by helping entrepreneurs bring their visions to life by (i) designing inclusive, dynamic, and interactive ed tech and learning experiences; (ii) providing innovation tools like no-code prototyping; and (iii) introducing our participants to artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and digital outreach and research skills.\n\nAs an ed tech nonprofit, we leverage technology to create flexible and responsive learning solutions, be they hybrid, in-person, or fully remote gamified and engaging learning techniques. \n\nOur program is designed and delivered by social entrepreneurs and educators from the community\n\nCambio founder Sebasti\u00e1n\u2019s background as an educator and an entrepreneur enables Cambio Labs to create a robust curriculum that addresses rapidly evolving changes in how society needs to engage and prepare youth. \n\nWe embrace liberatory design to create curriculum\n\nWe actively challenge systemic barriers by encouraging entrepreneurs to create projects and businesses that center their communities, which have been historically underestimated and excluded from the entrepreneurship scene.  \n\n5. Why we are unique in the Social Entrepreneurship Landscape\n\nBelow we mention incredible organizations working in a similar space, and how we are different.\n\nLearnServe International (Washington, DC) inspired Sebastian to become a socially responsible individual. He is one of their first graduates and was awarded their Entrepreneurship Award in 2018. Our main difference is our focus on low-income BIPOC students and that we do not serve private schools. Currently, their program costs students between $1250-2000; ours is free of charge to the students. In addition, our curriculum design specifically addresses the needs of each cohort by seeking input from the students, our partners, and the community. We also prioritize digitizing our curriculum to increase scalability and adopted a train-the-trainer program in NYC and San Francisco, in collaboration with the Mayor\u2019s program of Opportunities for All (OFA). \n\nProject Invent (San Francisco, CA) offers design thinking, engineering, and technology courses to students grades 9-12. Our organization also offers design thinking along with many other concepts and skills with distinct emphasis on social entrepreneurship. Moreover, we remain steadfast in our commitment to providing these learning experiences free of charge, or even as paid internships. Programs at Project Invent cost students between $495 for a year-long course and $1995 for the summer immersion program. They offer their curriculum open and free in the form of publicly available slides. Our curriculum uses a highly interactive, digitized, and gamified platform that enhances engagement and learning.\n\nUncharted Learning (Illinois) shares our goal of nurturing youth entrepreneurship (grades 6-12) and has introduced a train-the-trainer program. Our focus is social entrepreneurship\u2014a critical difference that guides our program development and delivery. Additionally, we ensure our programs remain accessible to all students. While they also partner with schools, the cost of Uncharted Learning's offerings is $1500-$2500 per student for their INCubatoredu Program and ACCELeratoredu Program, respectively, which often limits the participation of schools in their offerings.\n\n6. Why the team at Cambio Labs\n\nGrowing up, Cambio Labs founder, Sebasti\u00e1n Mart\u00edn, witnessed the hurdles his Latinx immigrant parents faced as BIPOC entrepreneurs. Upon launching his own social ventures, he realized neither the education nor entrepreneurship ecosystem was designed to prepare and empower social innovators in communities of color. \n\nFor his first social venture, he decided to leverage the power of direct trade to empower local indigenous cooperatives in his mother\u2019s country, Bolivia, and began exporting and retailing their coffee in Shanghai. By eliminating the traditional chain of intermediaries \u2013 who often absorb a large portion of profits \u2013 this approach allowed farmers to retain a greater share of the value they produced.\n\nThe challenges he faced during this 8-year venture made Sebastian recognize the scarcity of resources, mentorship, and second chances for entrepreneurs of color, and the failure of traditional education systems to adequately prepare students. He began teaching social entrepreneurship at universities, and, as the social innovation lead at a high school in New York, he realized that solutions available for delivering social entrepreneurship education for BIPOC youth were being delivered piecemeal with few coordinated resources, and within a system steeped in inequity. To address the issue, including the lack of coaching and mentorship in BIPOC communities by BIPOC coaches and mentors, he leveraged user-centered, liberatory design to create technology platforms and learning experiences that equip youth for 21st social challenges and employment. Through work-based learning solutions, he wants young social entrepreneurs to thrive in ways that our conventional high school infrastructure does not permit. To date, Cambio Labs has served over 230 young social entrepreneurs. \n\nMichelle Maluwetig, as the Director of Organizational Development, brings extensive experience as a business educator and advocate for underrepresented entrepreneurs. As a business educator and microfinance officer, she has worked diligently for entrepreneurs to gain access to capital, information and networks for underestimated and underserved communities and she works in partnership and institutional capacity building at Cambio to bring these resources to entrepreneurs, sooner, as early as middle school. She has extensive experience working with the latinx community from her work at the Organization of American States; the Latino Economic Development Center, and El Centro de la Raza.\n\nSarah Zou, in her role as a Product Strategist at Cambio Labs, brings a wealth of experience in digital strategy, product operations, and technical management, aligning perfectly with the project's goals. Her multilingual abilities and experience in multicultural settings are invaluable assets for a project focused on diverse BIPOC communities. Sarah's agile, data-driven approach, combined with her background in science and MBA, equips her to effectively navigate the complexities of emerging education, technology, and social entrepreneurship. Her track record in creating effective team processes and ensuring psychological safety makes her an essential member of the team, capable of leading the project team towards a socially impactful, innovative solution.",

    "question": "4. Why Cambio Labs?",
    "answer": "4. Why Cambio Labs?\n\nWe build cross-sectoral, community-based partnerships to allow for paid, work-based learning opportunities.\n\nOne example is our work with the RETI Center through our Green Workforce Development Initiative.  For 4 cohorts since 2021; participants have obtained stipends through Good Shepherd Services; Solar Panel Installation training through Brooklyn SolarWorks; Certification from OSHA and the Green Urban Council; and a certificate in Green Entrepreneurship through Cambio Labs. We were also able to digitalize the RETI Centers\u2019 coursework in solar panel installation on our platform, allowing this kind of programming to become more interactive, effective, and scalable.\n\nWe leverage and design technology to engage and empower underestimated communities\n\nOur program is designed to enable participants to harness technology and entrepreneurship as tools for social change.  We do this by helping entrepreneurs bring their visions to life by (i) designing inclusive, dynamic, and interactive ed tech and learning experiences; (ii) providing innovation tools like no-code prototyping; and (iii) introducing our participants to artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and digital outreach and research skills.\n\nAs an ed tech nonprofit, we leverage technology to create flexible and responsive learning solutions, be they hybrid, in-person, or fully remote gamified and engaging learning techniques. \n\nOur program is designed and delivered by social entrepreneurs and educators from the community\n\nCambio founder Sebasti\u00e1n\u2019s background as an educator and an entrepreneur enables Cambio Labs to create a robust curriculum that addresses rapidly evolving changes in how society needs to engage and prepare youth. \n\nWe embrace liberatory design to create curriculum\n\nWe actively challenge systemic barriers by encouraging entrepreneurs to create projects and businesses that center their communities, which have been historically underestimated and excluded from the entrepreneurship scene.  \n\n5. Why we are unique in the Social Entrepreneurship Landscape\n\nBelow we mention incredible organizations working in a similar space, and how we are different.\n\nLearnServe International (Washington, DC) inspired Sebastian to become a socially responsible individual. He is one of their first graduates and was awarded their Entrepreneurship Award in 2018. Our main difference is our focus on low-income BIPOC students and that we do not serve private schools. Currently, their program costs students between $1250-2000; ours is free of charge to the students. In addition, our curriculum design specifically addresses the needs of each cohort by seeking input from the students, our partners, and the community. We also prioritize digitizing our curriculum to increase scalability and adopted a train-the-trainer program in NYC and San Francisco, in collaboration with the Mayor\u2019s program of Opportunities for All (OFA). \n\nProject Invent (San Francisco, CA) offers design thinking, engineering, and technology courses to students grades 9-12. Our organization also offers design thinking along with many other concepts and skills with distinct emphasis on social entrepreneurship. Moreover, we remain steadfast in our commitment to providing these learning experiences free of charge, or even as paid internships. Programs at Project Invent cost students between $495 for a year-long course and $1995 for the summer immersion program. They offer their curriculum open and free in the form of publicly available slides. Our curriculum uses a highly interactive, digitized, and gamified platform that enhances engagement and learning.\n\nUncharted Learning (Illinois) shares our goal of nurturing youth entrepreneurship (grades 6-12) and has introduced a train-the-trainer program. Our focus is social entrepreneurship\u2014a critical difference that guides our program development and delivery. Additionally, we ensure our programs remain accessible to all students. While they also partner with schools, the cost of Uncharted Learning's offerings is $1500-$2500 per student for their INCubatoredu Program and ACCELeratoredu Program, respectively, which often limits the participation of schools in their offerings.\n\n6. Why the team at Cambio Labs\n\nGrowing up, Cambio Labs founder, Sebasti\u00e1n Mart\u00edn, witnessed the hurdles his Latinx immigrant parents faced as BIPOC entrepreneurs. Upon launching his own social ventures, he realized neither the education nor entrepreneurship ecosystem was designed to prepare and empower social innovators in communities of color. \n\nFor his first social venture, he decided to leverage the power of direct trade to empower local indigenous cooperatives in his mother\u2019s country, Bolivia, and began exporting and retailing their coffee in Shanghai. By eliminating the traditional chain of intermediaries \u2013 who often absorb a large portion of profits \u2013 this approach allowed farmers to retain a greater share of the value they produced.\n\nThe challenges he faced during this 8-year venture made Sebastian recognize the scarcity of resources, mentorship, and second chances for entrepreneurs of color, and the failure of traditional education systems to adequately prepare students. He began teaching social entrepreneurship at universities, and, as the social innovation lead at a high school in New York, he realized that solutions available for delivering social entrepreneurship education for BIPOC youth were being delivered piecemeal with few coordinated resources, and within a system steeped in inequity. To address the issue, including the lack of coaching and mentorship in BIPOC communities by BIPOC coaches and mentors, he leveraged user-centered, liberatory design to create technology platforms and learning experiences that equip youth for 21st social challenges and employment. Through work-based learning solutions, he wants young social entrepreneurs to thrive in ways that our conventional high school infrastructure does not permit. To date, Cambio Labs has served over 230 young social entrepreneurs. \n\nMichelle Maluwetig, as the Director of Organizational Development, brings extensive experience as a business educator and advocate for underrepresented entrepreneurs. As a business educator and microfinance officer, she has worked diligently for entrepreneurs to gain access to capital, information and networks for underestimated and underserved communities and she works in partnership and institutional capacity building at Cambio to bring these resources to entrepreneurs, sooner, as early as middle school. She has extensive experience working with the latinx community from her work at the Organization of American States; the Latino Economic Development Center, and El Centro de la Raza.\n\nSarah Zou, in her role as a Product Strategist at Cambio Labs, brings a wealth of experience in digital strategy, product operations, and technical management, aligning perfectly with the project's goals. Her multilingual abilities and experience in multicultural settings are invaluable assets for a project focused on diverse BIPOC communities. Sarah's agile, data-driven approach, combined with her background in science and MBA, equips her to effectively navigate the complexities of emerging education, technology, and social entrepreneurship. Her track record in creating effective team processes and ensuring psychological safety makes her an essential member of the team, capable of leading the project team towards a socially impactful, innovative solution.",

    "question": "4. Why Cambio Labs?",
    "answer": "4. Why Cambio Labs?\n\nWe build cross-sectoral, community-based partnerships to allow for paid, work-based learning opportunities.\n\nOne example is our work with the RETI Center through our Green Workforce Development Initiative.  For 4 cohorts since 2021; participants have obtained stipends through Good Shepherd Services; Solar Panel Installation training through Brooklyn SolarWorks; Certification from OSHA and the Green Urban Council; and a certificate in Green Entrepreneurship through Cambio Labs. We were also able to digitalize the RETI Centers\u2019 coursework in solar panel installation on our platform, allowing this kind of programming to become more interactive, effective, and scalable.\n\nWe leverage and design technology to engage and empower underestimated communities\n\nOur program is designed to enable participants to harness technology and entrepreneurship as tools for social change.  We do this by helping entrepreneurs bring their visions to life by (i) designing inclusive, dynamic, and interactive ed tech and learning experiences; (ii) providing innovation tools like no-code prototyping; and (iii) introducing our participants to artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and digital outreach and research skills.\n\nAs an ed tech nonprofit, we leverage technology to create flexible and responsive learning solutions, be they hybrid, in-person, or fully remote gamified and engaging learning techniques. \n\nOur program is designed and delivered by social entrepreneurs and educators from the community\n\nCambio founder Sebasti\u00e1n\u2019s background as an educator and an entrepreneur enables Cambio Labs to create a robust curriculum that addresses rapidly evolving changes in how society needs to engage and prepare youth. \n\nWe embrace liberatory design to create curriculum\n\nWe actively challenge systemic barriers by encouraging entrepreneurs to create projects and businesses that center their communities, which have been historically underestimated and excluded from the entrepreneurship scene.  \n\n5. Why we are unique in the Social Entrepreneurship Landscape\n\nBelow we mention incredible organizations working in a similar space, and how we are different.\n\nLearnServe International (Washington, DC) inspired Sebastian to become a socially responsible individual. He is one of their first graduates and was awarded their Entrepreneurship Award in 2018. Our main difference is our focus on low-income BIPOC students and that we do not serve private schools. Currently, their program costs students between $1250-2000; ours is free of charge to the students. In addition, our curriculum design specifically addresses the needs of each cohort by seeking input from the students, our partners, and the community. We also prioritize digitizing our curriculum to increase scalability and adopted a train-the-trainer program in NYC and San Francisco, in collaboration with the Mayor\u2019s program of Opportunities for All (OFA). \n\nProject Invent (San Francisco, CA) offers design thinking, engineering, and technology courses to students grades 9-12. Our organization also offers design thinking along with many other concepts and skills with distinct emphasis on social entrepreneurship. Moreover, we remain steadfast in our commitment to providing these learning experiences free of charge, or even as paid internships. Programs at Project Invent cost students between $495 for a year-long course and $1995 for the summer immersion program. They offer their curriculum open and free in the form of publicly available slides. Our curriculum uses a highly interactive, digitized, and gamified platform that enhances engagement and learning.\n\nUncharted Learning (Illinois) shares our goal of nurturing youth entrepreneurship (grades 6-12) and has introduced a train-the-trainer program. Our focus is social entrepreneurship\u2014a critical difference that guides our program development and delivery. Additionally, we ensure our programs remain accessible to all students. While they also partner with schools, the cost of Uncharted Learning's offerings is $1500-$2500 per student for their INCubatoredu Program and ACCELeratoredu Program, respectively, which often limits the participation of schools in their offerings.\n\n6. Why the team at Cambio Labs\n\nGrowing up, Cambio Labs founder, Sebasti\u00e1n Mart\u00edn, witnessed the hurdles his Latinx immigrant parents faced as BIPOC entrepreneurs. Upon launching his own social ventures, he realized neither the education nor entrepreneurship ecosystem was designed to prepare and empower social innovators in communities of color. \n\nFor his first social venture, he decided to leverage the power of direct trade to empower local indigenous cooperatives in his mother\u2019s country, Bolivia, and began exporting and retailing their coffee in Shanghai. By eliminating the traditional chain of intermediaries \u2013 who often absorb a large portion of profits \u2013 this approach allowed farmers to retain a greater share of the value they produced.\n\nThe challenges he faced during this 8-year venture made Sebastian recognize the scarcity of resources, mentorship, and second chances for entrepreneurs of color, and the failure of traditional education systems to adequately prepare students. He began teaching social entrepreneurship at universities, and, as the social innovation lead at a high school in New York, he realized that solutions available for delivering social entrepreneurship education for BIPOC youth were being delivered piecemeal with few coordinated resources, and within a system steeped in inequity. To address the issue, including the lack of coaching and mentorship in BIPOC communities by BIPOC coaches and mentors, he leveraged user-centered, liberatory design to create technology platforms and learning experiences that equip youth for 21st social challenges and employment. Through work-based learning solutions, he wants young social entrepreneurs to thrive in ways that our conventional high school infrastructure does not permit. To date, Cambio Labs has served over 230 young social entrepreneurs. \n\nMichelle Maluwetig, as the Director of Organizational Development, brings extensive experience as a business educator and advocate for underrepresented entrepreneurs. As a business educator and microfinance officer, she has worked diligently for entrepreneurs to gain access to capital, information and networks for underestimated and underserved communities and she works in partnership and institutional capacity building at Cambio to bring these resources to entrepreneurs, sooner, as early as middle school. She has extensive experience working with the latinx community from her work at the Organization of American States; the Latino Economic Development Center, and El Centro de la Raza.\n\nSarah Zou, in her role as a Product Strategist at Cambio Labs, brings a wealth of experience in digital strategy, product operations, and technical management, aligning perfectly with the project's goals. Her multilingual abilities and experience in multicultural settings are invaluable assets for a project focused on diverse BIPOC communities. Sarah's agile, data-driven approach, combined with her background in science and MBA, equips her to effectively navigate the complexities of emerging education, technology, and social entrepreneurship. Her track record in creating effective team processes and ensuring psychological safety makes her an essential member of the team, capable of leading the project team towards a socially impactful, innovative solution.",
