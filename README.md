1. flat and structured are for cambio-doc-upload

About: entirely llm based q&a matching

Results: have inconsistiencies the llm alone does not do a good job at differentiating between q and a


2. rule_based files

About: use a hybrid mix of rule-based regex matching and llm generation for q&a finding and category matching.

Results: seems to do a better job than just using the llm
only issue is some text/questions repeat and don't have answers - but the ones that are correctly matched also have pretty good category matching.
